# Cyber Threat Intelligence

Cyber Threat Intelligence can be defined as evidence-based knowledge about adversaries, indicators, tactics, motivations, and actionable advice against them.

**Data** = Indicators associated with an adversary such as IP addresses, URLs or hashes.

**Information** = Combination of multiple data points that answer questions.

**Intelligence** = Correlation of data and information to extract patterns of actions based on analysis.

The primary goal of CTI is to understand the relationship between operational environment and the adversary. Seek content by asking these questions:

* Who's attacking you?
* What are their motivations?
* What are their capabilities?
* What are the indicators of compromise (IOCs) to watch for?

Threat intelligence gathered from different sources under the following categories:

* **Internal**:
  * Corporate security events such as vulnerability assessments and incident response reports.
  * Cyber awareness training reports.
  * System logs and events.                                                                                                               &#x20;
* **Community**:
  * Open web forums.
  * Dark web communities for cyber-criminals.
* **External**:
  * Threat intel feeds (commercial and open-source).
  * Online marketplaces.
  * Public sources from government data, publications, social media, and financial assessments.

## Threat Intelligence Classifications

Threat intel is about understanding the relationship between the operational environment and the adversary.

### Strategic

High-level intel that reviews the organization's threat landscape and maps the risk areas based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that may impact business decisions.

### Technical

Looks into evidence/artifacts of the attack used by the adversary - Incident Response teams can use intel to create a baseline attack surface to analyze and develop defense mechanisms.

### Tactical

Assess adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to strengthen security controls and address vulnerabilities through real-time investigations.

### Operational

Look for specific motives and intent to perform an attack - Helpful to understand the critical assets in the organization (people, processes, and technologies) may be targeted.

## CTI Lifecycle

Threat Intel is a process that transforms raw data into context and action-oriented insights to triaging security incidents. The process follows a six-phase cycle:

### Direction

Every threat intel programs requires to have objectives and goals defined:

* Information assets and business process that require defending.
* Potential impact on losing assets or process interruptions.
* Sources of data and intel to be used towards defense.
* Tools and resources required to defend the assets.

### Collection

Analysts will gather the required data to complete their objectives through commercial, private and open-source resources. Recommend to automate this phase due to volume of data and more time to triage incidents.

### Processing

Ensure the data is extracted, sorted, organized, and presented in a usable and understandable format. SIEMs are valuable tools to quickly parse data from raw logs, vulnerability information, malware and network traffic from different formats.

### Analysis

Extract insights from data for decisions to be made:

* Investigating a potential threat through finding indicators and attack patterns.
* Defining an action plan to defend the infrastructure.
* Strengthening security controls or justifying investment for additional resources.

### Dissemination

Organizational stakeholders will review the intelligence to be informed about adversary activities, financial implications and strategic recommendations.

### Feedback

Analysts rely on the responses provided by stakeholders to imporve the threat intelligence process and implemenation of security controls.

## CTI Standards & Frameworks

Standards and frameworks provide structure and share the use of threat intel across industries to help in collaboration and communications. Commonly used standards and frameworks used are:

### MITRE ATT\&CK

[mitre.md](../mitre.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The [ATT\&CK framework](https://tryhackme.com/room/mitre) is a knowledge base of adversary behaviour, focusing on the indicators and tactics.

### TAXII

[The Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII)](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/taxii/intro) defines protocols for securely exchanging threat intel to have near real-time detection, prevention and mitigation of threats. The protocol supports two sharing models:

* **Collection**: Threat intel is collected and hosted by a producer upon request by users using a request-response model.
* **Channel**: Threat intel is pushed to users from a central server through a publish-subscribe model.

### STIX

[Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX)](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro) is a language developed to provides defined relationships between sets of threat info such as observables, indicators, adversary TTPs, attack campaigns, and more.

### Cyber Kill Chain

{% endcontent-ref %}

Developed by Lockheed Martin, the Cyber Kill Chain breaks down adversary actions into steps. This breakdown helps analysts and defenders identify which stage-specific activities occurred when investigating an attack.
