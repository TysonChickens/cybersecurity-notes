# MISP - Malware Information Sharing Platform

## Features & Terminologies

[Malware Information Sharing Platform](https://www.misp-project.org/) is an open-source threat information platform that has a collection, storage and distribution of threat intelligence and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) related to malware, cyber attacks, financial fraud or any intelligence within a community of trusted members.

The information can be distributed and consumed by Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), log analysis tools and Security Information and Event Management Systems (SIEM).

MISP is effective for:

* **Malware Reverse Engineering**: Sharing of malware indicators to understand how different malware families function.
* **Security Investigations**: Searching, validating and using indicators in investigating security breaches.
* **Intelligence Analysis**: Gathering information about adversary groups and their capabilities.
* **Law Enforcement**: Using indicators to support forensic investigations.
* **Risk Analysis**: Researching new threats, their likelihood and occurrences.
* **Fraud Analysis**: Sharing of financial indicators to detect financial fraud.

MISP core functionalities:

* **IOC database**: This allows for the storage of technical and non-technical information about malware samples, incidents, attackers and intelligence.
* **Automatic Correlation**: Identification of relationships between attributes and indicators from malware, attack campaigns or analysis.
* **Data Sharing**: This allows for sharing of information using different models of distributions and among different MISP instances.
* **Import & Export Features**: This allows the import and export of events in different formats to integrate other systems such as NIDS, HIDS, and OpenIOC.
* **Event Graph**: Showcases the relationships between objects and attributes identified from events.
* **API support**: Supports integration with own systems to fetch and export events and intelligence.

Common terms used within MISP:

* **Events**: Collection of contextually linked information.
* **Attributes**: Individual data points associated with an event, such as network or system indicators.
* **Objects**: Custom attribute compositions.
* **Object References**: Relationships between different objects.
* **Sightings**: Time-specific occurrences of a given data point or attribute detected to provide more credibility.
* **Tags**: Labels attached to events/attributes.
* **Taxonomies**: Classification libraries are used to tag, classify and organize information.
* **Galaxies**: Knowledge base items used to label events/attributes.
* **Indicators**: Pieces of information that can detect suspicious or malicious cyber activity.

## Using MISP

### Dashboard

* **Home button**: Returns you to the application's start screen, the event index page or the page set as a custom home page using the star in the top bar.
* **Event Actions**: All the malware data entered into MISP comprises an event object described by its connected attributes. The Event actions menu gives access to all the functionality related to the creation, modification, deletion, publishing, searching and listing of events and attributes.
* **Dashboard**: This allows you to create a custom dashboard using widgets.
* **Galaxies**: Shortcut to the list of [MISP Galaxies](https://github.com/MISP/misp-book/blob/main/galaxy) on the MISP instance. More on these on the Feeds & Taxonomies Task.
* **Input Filters**: Input filters alter how users enter data into this instance. Apart from the basic validation of attribute entry by type, the site administrators can define regular expression replacements and blocklists for specific values and block certain values from being exportable. Users can view these replacement and blocklist rules here, while an administrator can alter them.
* **Global Actions**: Access to information about MISP and this instance. You can view and edit your profile, view the manual, read the news or the terms of use again, see a list of the active organizations on this instance and a histogram of their contributions by an attribute type.
* **MISP**: Simple link to your base URL.
* **Name**: Name (Auto-generated from Mail address) of currently logged in user.
* **Envelope**: Link to User Dashboard to consult some of your notifications and changes since the last visit. Like some of the proposals received for your organization.
* **Log out**: The Log out button to end your session immediately.

### Event Management

Place to create all malware investigations by providing descriptions and attributes.

* Event creation
* Populate events with attributes and attachments
* Publishing

### Event Creation

Add the description, time, and risk level appropriate for the incident. Can specify the distribution level to MISP network and community.

* **Your organization only**: This only allows members of your organization to see the event.
* **This Community-only**: Users that are part of your MISP community will be able to see the event. This includes your organization, organizations on this MISP server and organizations running MISP servers that sync with this server.
* **Connected communities**: Users who are part of your MISP community will see the event, including all organizations on this MISP server, all organizations on MISP servers syncing with this server, and the hosting organizations of servers that are two hops away from this one.
* **All communities**: This will share the event with all MISP communities, allowing the event to be freely propagated from one server to the next.

### Attributes & Attachments

Attributes can be added manually or imported through other formats such as OpenIOC and ThreatConnect. Some essential options to note:

* **For Intrusion Detection System**: Allows the attribute to be used as an IDS signature when exported NIDS data.
* **Batch Import**: If there are several attributes of the same type, it is possible to join them into the same value field and create separate lines for each attribute.

### Publish Event

When events are created, the _organizational admin_ will review and publish those events to the distribution channels.

## Feeds & Taxonomies

Feeds are resources that contain indicators that can be imported into MISP. These feeds provide continuous updated information on threats and adversaries to aid in defense against attacks.

MISP Feeds provide a way to:

* Exchange threat information.
* Preview events along with associated attributes and objects.
* Select and import events to your instance.
* Correlate attributes identified between events and feeds.

### Taxonomies

A means of classifying information based on standard features or attributes. On MISP, taxonomies are used to categorize events, indicators and threat actors based on tags to identify them.

* Set events for processing by external tools such as VirusTotal.
* Ensure events are classified appropriately.
* Export values with tags to fit specific deployments for IDS.
