# OpenCTI

[OpenCTI](https://www.opencti.io/) is another open-source platform designed to provide organizations the resources to manage CTI through the storage, analysis, visualization and presentation of threats, malware and IOCs.

Main objective to create a comprehensive tools to allow users to utilize technical and non-technical information. The platform can use the MITRE ATTA\&CK framework to structure the data and integrate other threat intel tools such as MISP and TheHive.

## OpenCTI Data Model

Uses a variety of knowledge schemas to structure data - Main one is Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX2) standards. The image below provides how the platform's architecture is organized.

* **GraphQL API** connects clients to the database and the messaging system.
* **Write workers** (Python) processes write queries asynchronously from the RabbitMQ messaging system.
* **Connectors** are another set of Python processes to digest or export data on the platform. These provide the application with a network of integrated systems and frameworks to create threat intelligence relations.

    | **External Input Connector**       | Ingests information from external sources                    | CVE, MISP, TheHive, MITRE |
    | **Stream Connector**               | Consumes platform data stream                                | History, Tanium           |
    | **Internal Enrichment Connector**  | Takes in new OpenCTI entities from user requests             | Observables enrichment    |
    | **Internal Import File Connector** | Extracts information from uploaded reports                   | PDFs, STIX2 Import        |
    | **Internal Export File Connector** | Exports information from OpenCTI into different file formats | CSV, STIX2 export, PDF    |
