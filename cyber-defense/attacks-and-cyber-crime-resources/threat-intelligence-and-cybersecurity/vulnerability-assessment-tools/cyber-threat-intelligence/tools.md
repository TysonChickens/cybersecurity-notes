## URLScan.io

[Urlscan.io](https://urlscan.io) is a free service developed to assist in scanning and analyzing websites. It is used to automate the process of browsing and crawling through websites to record activities and interactions. Records information about:

* Domains and IP addresses contacted
* Resources requested from the domains
* A snapshot of the web page, technologies used, and other metadata about the website

### Scan Results

URL scan results with essential areas to look at:

* **Summary**: Provides general information about the URL, from the IP address, domain registration details, page history and a screenshot of the site.
* **HTTP**: Information about the HTTP connections with details and the file types.
* **Redirects**: Any identified HTTP and client-side redirects on the site.
* **Links**: All identified links outgoing from the homepage.
* **Behavior**: Details of the variables and cookies found on the site -&#x20;
* **Indicators**: Lists all IPs, domains and hashes associated with the site - does not imply any malicious activity.

## Abuse.ch

A research project by Institute for Cybersecurity and Engineering at the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland - Identify and track malware and botnets with these platforms:

* **Malware Bazaar**: Sharing malware samples.
* **Feodo Tracker**: Track botnet command and control (C2) infrastructure linked with Emotet, Dridex and TrickBot.
* **SSL Blacklist**: Blocklist for malicious SSL certificates and JA3/JA3s fingerprints.
* **URL Haus**: Sharing malware distribution sites.
* **Threat Fox**: Sharing indicators of compromise (IOCs).

### [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/)

All in one malware collection and analysis database:

* **Malware Samples Upload**: Security analysts can upload malware samples for  analysis and build intelligence.
* **Malware Hunting**: Hunt for malware samples through setting up alerts to match their tags, signatures, YARA rules, ClamAV signatures and vendor detection.

### [FeodoTracker](https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/)

Provide a database of the C\&C servers security analysts can search through and investigate any suspicious IP addresses.

* Includes various IP and IOC blocklists and mitigation information to be used to prevent botnet infections.

### [SSL Blacklist](https://sslbl.abuse.ch/)

Identify and detect malicious SSL certificates used by botnet C2 servers identified and updated on a deny list provided for use.

* Deny list used to identify JA3 fingerprints to detect and block malware botnet C2 communications on the TCP layer.

### [URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/)

Focus on sharing malicious URLs used for malware distribution through database to search for domains, URLs, hashes and file types.

### [ThreatFox](https://threatfox.abuse.ch/)

Search for, share and export indicators of compromise associated with malware. IOCs can be exported to formats such as MISP events, Suricata IDS Ruleset, Domain Host files, DNS Response Policy Zone, JSON files and CSV files.

## [PhishTool](https://www.phishtool.com/)

Email phishing is one of the main precursor of any cyber attack. PhishTool provides tools for email analysis to allow security analysts to uncover email IOCs, prevent breaches and provide forensic reports for containment and training purposes. Core features include:

* **Perform email analysis**: Retrives metadata from phishing emails and provides explanations and capabilities to follow the email's actions, attachments, and URLS to triage.
* **Heuristic intelligence**: OSINT is built-in to stay ahead of persistent attacks and understand what TTPs used to evade security.
* **Classification and reporting**: Phishing email classifications are conducted so reports can be generated to provide a forensic record to be shared.

Additional features are available on the Enterprise version:

* Manage user-reported phishing events.
* Report phishing email findings back to the user.
* Email stack integration with Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace.

### Analysis

Details of email:

* **Headers**: Source and destination email addresses, original IP and DNS addresses with Timestamp.
* **Received Lines**: Details on traversal process across various SMTP servers for tracing purposes.
* **X-headers**: Extension headers added by the recipient mailbox to provide additional information about the email.
* **Security**: Details on email security frameworks and policies (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
* **Attachments**: Lists any file attachments found in the email.
* **Message URLs**: Associated external URLs found in the email.

## [Cisco Talos Intelligence](https://talosintelligence.com/)

A large team assembled from Cisco to provide actionable intelligence, visibility on indicators, and protection against threats through data collected from their products. They have 6 key teams:

* **Threat Intelligence & Interdiction**: Correlation and tracking of threats to turn IOCs into context-rich intel.
* **Detection Research**: Vulnerability and malware analysis performed to create rules for threat detection.
* **Vulnerability Research & Discovery**: Work with service and software vendors to develop, identify, and report security vulnerabilities.
* **Communities**: Maintains the reputation and open-source solutions.
* **Global Outreach**: Share intelligence to customers and the security community through publications.

Primary tabs for an analyst to review:

* **Vulnerability Information**: Disclosed and zero-day vulnerabilities reports marked with CVE numbers and CVSS scores.
* **Reputation Center:** Provides access to searchable threat data related to IPs and files using their SHA256 hashes. Additional email and spam data can be found under the **Email & Spam Data tab**.
