# OpenVAS

OpenVAS is an application used to scan endpoints and web applications to identify and detect vulnerabilities. Commonly used by corporations to quickly identify any gaps in their production or development servers or applications.

OpenVAS is built off the GreenBone Vulnerability Management (GVM) solution.

* A service within a larger framework of services known as GreenBone Vulnerability Management (GVM)

**Vulnerability/Information Feed (NVT, SCAP CERT, User Data, Community Feed)** - Contains all information and vulnerability tests from the Greenbone Community Feed as a main baseline for testing against systems.

**Back-End (OSP, OpenVAS, Targets)** - The infrastructure to conduct all of the vulnerability scanning and processing data and NVTS through OpenVAS and GVM. Greenbone Vulnerability Manager will be the middle man between the scanners and the front-end user interfaces.

**Front-End (GSA, Web Interfaces)** - Interact and navigate OpenVAS with browser web interfaces.

## Installing OpenVAS

The installation procedure for OpenVAS can vary depending on how to install:

* Kali/OpenVAS repositories
* Install from source - Least preferred option for beginners and the least optimized way of installing OpenVAS due to prerequisites and make errors. For more information about installing from source look at the [INSTALL.MD](https://github.com/greenbone/openvas-scanner/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
* Run from a docker container - For more information, checkout the openvas-docker project on [GitHub](https://github.com/mikesplain/openvas-docker) and [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mikesplain/openvas/dockerfile).

## Report and Continuous Monitoring

OpenVAS has a strong reporting and monitoring capabilities for automated reporting capabilities.

Each automated report begins with basic host and task information - summary for host authentications and open ports on the host.

### Continuous Monitoring

OpenVAS offers many options for monitoring/vulnerability management. Examples of continuous vulnerability scanning utilities are Alerts, Schedules, and Agents.

* Create schedules via _Configuration -> Schedules -_ Basic information includes Names, First Start Time, Period, etc.
* Creating alerts is similar: _Configuration -> Alerts_ - The main options are Name, Event, Condition, and To Address.
