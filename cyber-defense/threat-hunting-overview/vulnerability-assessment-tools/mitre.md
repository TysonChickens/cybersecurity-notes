# MITRE

MITRE researchs in many areas outside of cybersecurity, for the "safety, stability, and well-being of our nation". These areas include artificial intelligence, health informatics, space security, and more.

MITRE Corporation projects/research:

* ATT\&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework
* CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base
* ENGAGE (Not a fancy acronym)
* D3FEND (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense)
* AEP (ATT\&CK Emulation Plans)

## Terminology

APT: **Advanced Persistent Threat** - Considered a team/group (**threat group**), or a country (**nation-state group**), that engages in long-term attacks against organizations and/or countries. The term "advanced" is misleading to a super-weapon, but the techniques used by APT groups are common and can be detected. Here are FireEye's current list of APT groups [**here**](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html)**.**

TTP: **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures**

* **Tactic** is the adversary's goal or objective.
* **Technique** is how the adversary achieves the goal or objective.
* **Procedure** is how the technique is used.

## ATT\&CK Framework

According to the [website](https://attack.mitre.org/), "MITRE ATT\&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations." In 2013, MITRE began to address the need to record and document common TTPs that APT groups used against enterprise Windows networks. This started with an internal project known as FMX (Fort Meade Experiment), and the data collected from the attacks helped construct the beginning pieces of the ATT\&CK framework.

## CAR Knowledge Base

_The official definition of CAR is the "MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) is a knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE. CAR defines a data model that is leveraged in its pseudo code representations but also includes implementations directly targeted at specific tools (e.g Splunk, EQL) in its analytics. CAR is focusd on providing a set of validated and well-explained analytics, in particular with regards to their operating theory and rationale._

Reviewing [CAR-2020-09-001: Scheduled Task - File Access](https://car.mitre.org/analytics/CAR-2020-09-001/).

* Given a brief description of the analytic and references to ATT\&CK (technique, sub-technique, and tactic).
* Pseudo-code and a query on how to search for this specific analytic within Splunk. A pseudo-code is a plain, human-readable way to describe a set of instructions or algorithms that a program or system will perform.

### Analytics

In the Full Analytic List view, see what implementations are available for any given analytic at a single glance, along with what OS platform it applies to.

Under Implementations, a pseudo-code is provided and an EQL version of the pseudo-code. EQL (Event Query Language) can be utilized to query, parse, and organize Sysmon event data.

## [MITRE Engage](https://engage.mitre.org/)

_MITRE Engage is a framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations that empowers you to engage your adversaries and achieve your cybersecurity goals._

MITRE Engage is considered an Adversary Engagement Approach - Implementation of Cyber Denial and Cyber Deception.

* Cyber Denial prevent the adversary's ability to conduct their operations.
* Cyber Deception intentionally plant artifacts to mislead the adversary.

The Engage website provides a [starter kit](https://engage.mitre.org/starter-kit/) to get you 'started' with the Adversary Engagement Approach. The starter kit is a collection of whitepapers and PDFs explaining various checklists, methodologies, and processes.

* Prepare the set of operational actions that will lead to your desired outcome.
* Expose adversaries when they trigger deployed deception activities.
* Affect adversaries by performing actions that will have a negative impact on their operations.
* Elicit information by observing the adversary and learn more about their modus operandi (TTPs).
* Understand the outcomes of the operational actions (output).

## MITRE [D3FEND](https://d3fend.mitre.org/)

This resource is a "knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures". D3FEND is still in beta and is funded by the Cybersecurity Directorate of the NSA.

D3FEND stands for **Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense**.

## ATT\&CK® Emulation Plans

MITRE formed an organization named the Center of Threat-Informed Defense (CTID). This organization consists of various companies and vendors from around the globe. Their objective is to conduct research on cyber threats and their TTPs and share the research to improve cyber defense for all.

Some of the companies and vendors who are participants of CTID:

* AttackIQ (founder)
* Verizon
* Microsoft (founder)
* Red Canary (founder)
* Splunk

The[ Adversary Emulation Library](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary\_emulation\_library) & ATT\&CK Emulation is a public library making adversary emulation plans a free resource for blue/red team. The emulation plans are a step-by-step guide on how to mimic the specific threat group.

## ATT\&CK and Threat Intelligence

Threat Intelligence (TI) or Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is the information, or TTPs, attributed to the adversary.

* With threat intelligence, defenders can make better decisions regarding the defensive strategy. Large corporations may have an in-house team whose primary objective is to gather threat intelligence for other teams within the organization. Some of this intel can be open source or through a subscription with a vendor such as CrowdStrike.
* The goal of threat intelligence is to make the information actionable.
