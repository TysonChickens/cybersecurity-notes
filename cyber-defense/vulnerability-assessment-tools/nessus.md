# Nessus

Nessus uses similar techiniques to Nmap to find and report vulnerabilities, presented in a nice GUI. Nessus does not make assumptions when scanning, like assuming the web application is running on port 80.

Nessus offers a free and paid service and their pricing is similar to Burp Suite. More details on pricing options here: [https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)
