* Decide which incident to focus on next.
* Identify the name of the malware.
* Take newly found Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from the Internet and search from them back in SIEM.
* Find other Internal IPs are potentially infected with the same malware.
* Search Threat Feeds + Search Engine + Virus total + favorite tools for these outliers / indicators; Find new malware at play.

* Review the payload outlying events for anything interesting (domains, MD5s, etc.)
* Search more websites for IOC information that malware from the Internet.
