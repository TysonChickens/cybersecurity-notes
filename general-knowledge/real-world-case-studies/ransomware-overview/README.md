[Ransomware is a type of malware that infects computer systems, restricting users’ access to the infected systems. Ransomware variants have been observed for several years and often attempt to extort money from victims by displaying an on-screen alert. Typically, these alerts state that the user’s systems have been locked or that the user’s files have been encrypted. Users are told that unless a ransom is paid, access will not be restored. The ransom demanded from individuals varies greatly but is frequently $200–$400 dollars and must be paid in virtual currency, such as Bitcoin.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA16-091A)

## Types of Ransomware

### Crypto

* Encrypt the sensitive files located on the victim's computer, such as documents, pictures, or videos to prevent access until ransom is paid.

### Locker

* Solely aims to lock victims out of their entire computer devices until ransom is paid.

### Leakware/Doxware

* Threaten to release footage from webcam, or any incriminating files that may be on a computer.
  * May release to the public or specific people until ransom is paid.

## Attack Vectors

There are many different ways a user can fall victim to a ransomware, though most can be avoided with proper security education and protocols.

* Phishing
* Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
* Software vulnerabilities
* Malicious Links

## Prevention

The best way to prevent being a victim of ransomware is to keep a backup of all your data, keep your software up to date and use complex passwords for your network and computer.

* Use an anti-virus or related security software, and stay vigilant in verifying any link or attachment you click on.

### Backup

Having a full backup removes the threat of losing data.

### Update Software & Passwords

Updated software and strong passwords is the first line of defense.

### Antivirus

Security software scanning for malicious attachments or changes to computer combats phishing.

### Beware of Links

Beyond emails, websites can be spoofed and visiting or clicking on links can download ransomware.

## Examples

[Infections can be devastating to an individual or organization, and recovery can be a difficult process that may require the services of a reputable data recovery specialist. Paying the ransom does not guarantee the encrypted files will be released; it only guarantees that the malicious actors receive the victim’s money, and in some cases, their banking information. In addition, decrypting files does not mean the malware infection itself has been removed.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA16-091A)

### Why it is Effective

The authors of ransomware instill fear and panic into their victims, causing them to click on a link or pay a ransom, and users systems can become infected with additional malware.

* “Your computer was used to visit websites with illegal content. To unlock your computer, you must pay a $100 fine.”
* “Your computer has been infected with a virus. Click here to resolve the issue.”
* “All files on your computer have been encrypted. You must pay this ransom within 72 hours to regain access to your data.”

### Locky

* Encrypts over 160 file types.
* Uses phishing to target those with designer, engineering, or developer file types.

### WannaCry

* Spread across 150 countries in 2017.
* Capitalized on out of date software in the healthcare industry.
* 4 billion in losses worldwide.

### Bad Rabbit

* Used fake adobe flash website to install malware.

### Ryuk

* Spread in 2018 and disabled the Windows System Restore button.
* Encrypted networked drives as well.

### Troldesh

* Was popular in 2015 and went for quantity over quality.
* Caught victims through spam email links and attachments.

### Jigsaw

* Named after the Saw horror films.
* "Tormented" victims by deleting files incrementally with each hour the ransom was not paid.

### CryptoLocker

* Spread through email attachments.
* Impacted half million computers.
* Was countered by law enforcement.

### Petya

* Precursor to GoldenEye.
* Encrypted entire hard drive.

### GoldenEye

* Resurfaced around the same time WannaCry was popular.
* Targeted high profile users and locked them out completely.

### GandCrab

* Claimed to have used the users webcam to record personal moments and threatened to release the footage unless a ransom was paid.

## Ransomware of Things (RoT)

* An organization become increasingly dependent on tech solutions, the scope for ransomware only increases.
* The increasing use of internet-connected industrial control systems, smart buildings, and vehicles including autonomous vehicles is creating new areas of exploitation.
* Remote locking of vehicles, homes, and buildings could be abused for extortion.
  * Manipulation of BAS such as those controlling HVAC could serve as a basis for new schemes.
