# City of Atlanta

## Case Study - City of Atlanta

* In the early morning of March 22, 2018, the City of Atlanta suffered a widespread Ransomware attack.
* The breach shuttered many devices at City Hall for about five days in an extensive infection.
* The virus used to attack the city was the SamSam Ransomware.
* To unlock the city's systems, and data, hackers demanded by $51,000 in Bitcoin, in which the city refused to pay.

### Timeline

1. March 22, 2018: Ransomware cyberattack dealt a widespread blow to the city of Atlanta, the state capital and home to the nation's busiest airport.

* Devices at City Hall shut down for five days.
* Law enforcement temporarily writing incident reports by hand and video.
* Stopping online or in-person payments of tickets, water bills, and business licenses, and renewals.

1. Atlanta disabled the Wi-Fi at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport until April 2nd.
2. In May, the city restored its online water bill payment system.
3. In June, the court's online bill payment option and docket boards returned.

### Vulnerabilities

There was no plan in place if an attack occurred.

#### Operations During an Attack

Despite the breach, Atlanta's 911 system and its emergency response was unaffected, and major utilities including water and sewer services continued.

* Retained the manual processes and institutional knowledge needed to revert to traditional methods of service provision and had plans in place to keep doing business during the attack.
* Did not understand the impact of the threat on all operations.

#### Readiness of Systems

* Lack of spending upgrading their infrastructure.
* Large number of vulnerabilities logged in a January 2018 audit.
  * Found 1,500 to 2,000 vulnerabilities in the city systems, and suggested that the number of vulnerabilities had so large that workers grew complacent.

### Cost

* The attack could cost taxpayers $17 million - up from earlier estimates of 2.7 million.
* The latest cost estimate includes about $6 million in existing contracts for security services and software upgrades and 11 million in potential costs associated with the attack, including new desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets.
* This would mark one of the U.S.' costliest cyberattacks affecting a local government in 2018, despite city officials declining to pay the ransom demanding by the hackers.

### Prevention

* IT officials must know their network architecture, invest in email infrastructure, and remain vigilant at all levels, scrutinizing emails and their attachments and looking for browser vulnerabilities.
* Multi-factor authentication is immensely valuable and segmentation is crucial.
* State and local governments should have security zones segmented well within their own network.
* Agencies should have a plan to do backups, to back up data regularly and make it secure.
* Agencies should consult guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

### Moving Forward

* Atlanta officials highlight the importance of protecting government data and information.
* The city's approach to cybersecurity now rests on three pillars:
  * Governance with compliance
  * Vulnerability management
  * Overall threat management
* To limit the financial impact of an incident or breach, a cyber-insurance policy can serve as a road map.
* An organization should step back from the smaller day-to-day tasks of enterprise-level IT management and cybersecurity to see the larger view.
* Since becoming Atlanta's CIO in October 2018, Atlanta Chief Information Officer Gary Brantley has focused on building a continuity plan.
* Wendi Whitmore, IBM's vice president of X-Force Threat Intelligence, said on this attack that running through drills can reveal critical weaknesses that allow cyberattacks to take place, as well as simple prevention efforts that can protect against extensive damage.
