## Getting Started with ATT\&CK

Can be useful for any organization that wants to move toward a threat-informed defense.

* Level 1 for those starting out who may not have many resources.
  * Cyber threat intelligence is all about knowing what your adversaries do and using that information to improve decision-making.
* Level 2 for mid-level teams starting to mature.
  * Team of threat analysts who regularly review information about adversaries, a next-level action to take is to map intelligence to ATT\&CK yourself rather than using what others have already mapped.
* Level 3 for more advanced cybersecurity teams and resources.
  * If CTI team is advanced, start to map more information to ATT\&CK, and then use that information to prioritize how to defend.

1. Understand ATT\&CK
2. Find the behavior
3. Research the behavior
4. Translate the behavior into a tactic
5. Figure out what technique applies to the behavior
6. Compare results to other analysts

### Best Practices for Intelligent Detection

1. Predict and prioritize security weaknesses.
   * Gather threat intelligence information.
   * Manage vulnerabilities and risks.
   * Augment vulnerability scan data with context for optimized prioritization.
   * Manage device configurations (firewalls, switches, routers, IPS/IDS).
2. Detect deviations to identify malicious activity.
   * Establish baseline behaviors.
   * Monitor and investigate anomalies.
   * Monitor network flows.
3. React in real time to exploits.
   * Correlate logs, events, network flows, identities, assets, vulnerabilities, and configurations, and add context.
   * Use automated and cognitive solutions to make data actionable by existing staff.

## Security Intelligence

Security Intelligence : The real-time collection, normalization, and analytics of the data generated by users, applications, and infrastructure that impacts the IT security and risk posture of an enterprise.

* Provides actionable and comprehensive insight for managing risks and threats from protection and detection through remediation.

### The Exploit Timeline - Ask the Right Questions

* What are the major risks and vulnerabilities?
* Are we configured to protect against advanced threats?
* What security incidents are happening right now?
* What was the impact to the organization?

### 3 Pillars of Effective Threat Detection

* See Everything
* Automate Intelligence
* Become Protective
