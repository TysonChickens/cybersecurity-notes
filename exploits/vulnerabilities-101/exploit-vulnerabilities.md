# Exploit Vulnerabilities

There are some means of identifying vulnerabilities and combining research skills to learn how they can be abused.

## Automated vs. Manual Vulnerability Search

There are many tools and services available in cybersecurity for vulnerability scanning.

* From being commercial to open-source and free.
* Vulnerability scanners are convenient for canvassing application for flaws.
  * [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) has both a free (community) edition and commercial.

Vulnerability scanner:

| Advantage                                                                                  | Disadvantage                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Automated scans are easy to repeat, and the results can be shared within a team with ease. | People can often become reliant on these tools.                                                    |
| Quick and can test numerous applications efficiently.                                      | Extremely "loud" and produce a lot of traffic and logging. Not good if trying to bypass firewalls. |
| Open-source solutions exist.                                                               | Open-source solutions are often basic and require expensive licenses to have useful features.      |
| Cover a wide range of different vulnerabilities that may be hard to manually search for.   | Often do not find every vulnerability on an application.                                           |

* Frameworks such as Metasploit often have vulnerability scanners for some modules.

Manual scanning for vulnerabilities if often the weapon of choice by a penetration tester when testing individual applications or programs.

* Manual scanning involves searching for the same vulnerabilities and uses similar techniques as automated scanning.
* Both techniques involve testing an application or program for vulnerabilities.

| Vulnerability              | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Security Misconfigurations | Involve vulnerabilities due to developer oversight. For example, exposing server information in messages between the application and an attacker.     |
| Broken Access Control      | Occurs when an attacker is able to access parts of an application that they are not supposed to access.                                               |
| Insecure Deserialization   | Insecure processing of data that is sent across an application. An attacker may be able to pass malicious code to the application, and then executed. |
| Injection                  | Exists when an attacker is able to input malicious data into an application due to failure of not ensuring input is not harmful.                      |

## Finding Manual Exploits

### Rapid7

Similar to other services such as ExploitDB and NVE, Rapid7 is a vulnerability research database.

* Can filter by type of vulnerability (i.e. application and operating system).

### GitHub

GitHub is a popular web service designed for software developers. The site is used to host and share the source code of applications to allow collaborative effort.

* Security researchers store and share PoC's (Proof of Concept).
* Extremely useful finding rare or fresh exploits because anyone can create and account and upload.
* Uses a tagging and keyword system meaning we can search Github by keywords such as "PoC" and "vulnerability" and more.

### Searchsploit

A popular tool available on pentesting distributions such as Kali Linux.

* Offline copy of Exploit-DB, containing copies of exploits on the system.
* Able to search by application name and/or vulnerability type.
